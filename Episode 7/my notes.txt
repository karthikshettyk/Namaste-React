React router dom is the package is needs to be imported used for routing

npm install react-router-dom

To config the routes - createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom

To provide the config to app component, we need to import Provider from react router dom

<Provider config=config />

const config = createBrowserRouter(
                                   path:"/",
                                   element:<App/>
                                   error:"<Error/>
                                   children:[
                                       path:"/about",
                                       element:<About/>
                                            ]
                                  );

It provider should be given in the config root.render()

To use the it as {LINK} from react-router-dom

<Link to="/about">About </Link>

Two types of routing:

1)Client-Side Routing

2)Server-Side Routing

1)Client Side Routing:
                      The client side routing does not calls the network to get the pages to render and the page doesnt refresh.
                      ex:react-router-dom

2)Server-Side Routing:
                     While routing it calls the network get the UI and display that page to the UI.
                     It is old style of rendering, The page will refreesh
                     ex:JSX

Single page application, In one page, all the routes are loaded does not take any refreshing of the page.

Dynamic routing - /:id

useparams hook from the react router dom to access the dynamic data
