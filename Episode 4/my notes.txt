Episode 4:

We are starting the namaste food delivery app like zomato and swiggy where we will use the swiggy api

Before building the food delivery app, we should plan the website like Header, body and footer

In header we have logo, sub links and cart 

In body we have the serach bar and items display with the price like cards

In footer we have the copyright or trademark about the company and its address, contact details

Before building the app, there should be wireframe or mock screens.
